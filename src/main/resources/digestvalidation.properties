# shared keys. they can be different or exactly the same for incoming and outgoing digests.
# You can also simply specificy "shared_secret" if they are the same 
# one can append a ".serviceURL" to the names to bind service-specific secrets
# the secret that provides the most specific match will be used
# examples:
#   shared_secret=my_shared_secret
#   shared_secret.http://paywizard.com=secret used for "http://paywizard.com" serviceURL
#   shared_secret_incoming=secret for incoming digests
#   shared_secret_outgoing.http://paywizard.com=secret for outgoing digests for "http://paywizard.com" serviceURL
shared_secret_incoming=something
shared_secret_response=something

# the character encoding of the digest. You'll probably want to keep it iso-8859-1 
encoding=iso-8859-1
# the hash function. use SHA-1, SHA-256 or other members from the SHA family (MD5 should also work)
hashfunction=SHA-256
